  _description: It's the result of the hybridization between the Lavandula X and
    the Lion Flower. It's a tiny flower and its coloring comes in a lot of variations.
    When it's completely dark, two small yellow speck of light can be seen emitted
    from the flower. It appears to be sentient, even though communication seems to
    be out of question.  With the current technology it is NOT possible further hybridization.
