  _description: On the Old Earth, centuries ago, to sustain the lives of billions
    of people during dire times, this new type of gourd has been developed. It's
    a cucumber, melon, watermelon and pumpkin hybrid. Capable of being a great source
    of both food and water, it soon became as essential as air to survive.  It seems
    it can be used for further experimentation with the plants of the New Earth.
