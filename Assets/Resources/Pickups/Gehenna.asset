  _description: It's a cactus-like lifeform, it can be found on the New Earth in
    the Desert region. It's flowers, from the moment they bloom, are constantly on
    fire until they die. The core of this plant reaches extremely high temperatures,
    its roots are buried deep within the New Earth to get the nutrients that it needs
    from magma. Please be careful, do not touch the stem directly.  With the current
    technology it is possible to hybridize this plant with some of the ones from
    the Old Earth.
