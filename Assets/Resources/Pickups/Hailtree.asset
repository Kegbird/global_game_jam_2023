  _description: Found in the Mountain Region on the New Earth, it strongly resembles
    the ancient extinct pine. It's made of a material similar to ice, but it doesn't
    melt and it's definitely alive. When the strong icy wind blow through its branches,
    it whistles so loud that it can be heard from miles away. Around these trees
    fine hail falls perpetually.  With the current technology it is possible to hybridize
    this plant with some of the ones from the Old Earth.
