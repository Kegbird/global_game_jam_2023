  _description: It's the result of the hybridization between the Corylus X and the
    Hailtree. The Hybrid of these two trees is somehow made out of a material similar
    to metal. It's extremely cold to the touch and its impenetrable bark could be
    used as a new construction material. Further studies must be conducted.  With
    the current technology it is NOT possible further hybridization.
