  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the Cucurbita X and the
    Gehenna. It inherited the outstanding resistance to the New Earth soil from the
    Gehenna genome. This results are better than any other hybrid, even though the
    plant still can't survive for too long outside. Further studies must be conducted
    in this field. We're close to the solution.  With the current technology it is
    possible further hybridization.
