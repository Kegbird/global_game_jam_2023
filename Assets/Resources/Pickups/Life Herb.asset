  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the Lavandula X and the
    Fere Moss. This purple herb, that resembles somehow the now extinct spider lily,
    has extremely strong healing abilities, it doesn't need much water and it's really
    resilient. It is hypothesized that it can never die.  With the current technology
    it is possible further hybridization.
