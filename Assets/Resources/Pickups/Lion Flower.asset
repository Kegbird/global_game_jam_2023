  _name: LION FLOWER
  _description: Its habitat is located in the Forest Region of the New Earth. It's
    a giant black flower that copies the features of a lion, both in life and death.
    When it finally dies (similarly to the ancient snapdragon flower) it looks like
    a lion skull. It's presumed it is for its own survival and it is completely harmless,
    but more studies must be conducted.  With the current technology it is possible
    to hybridize this plant with some of the ones from the Old Earth.
