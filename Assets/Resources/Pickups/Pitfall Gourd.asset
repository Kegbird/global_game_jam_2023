  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the Cucurbita X and the
    Medusa Flytrap. It looks like a cobra, it's a carnivorous plant that feeds on
    the prays that fall inside of it. It attracts them with a high pitch melody that
    "enchants" them and makes them move towards the plant like they're hypnotized. 
    With the current technology it is NOT possible further hybridization.
