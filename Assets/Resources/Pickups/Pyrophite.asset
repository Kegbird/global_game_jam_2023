  _description: 'Its the result of the hybridization between the Corylus X and the
    Gehenna. The reproduction method of this specimen is very peculiar: the tree
    needs to be on fire. Its serotinous cones are completely sealed with resin and
    can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically
    melted the resin.  With the current technology it is NOT possible further hybridization.'
