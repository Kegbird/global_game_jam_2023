  _description: It's the result of the hybridization between the Lavandula X and
    the Snowheap. The flower is very short lived, it's composed of hundreds of tiny
    seed, each seed set in a snowflake. The slightest breeze causes them to fly away. 
    With the current technology it is NOT possible further hybridization.
