  _description: This is the result of multiple genetic combinations, executed on
    the Old Earth, among the endangered species of hazel, birch, alder and hornbeam.
    Specifically created for its resistant and durable wood, it became also the source
    of hornuts, perfect for making sweets.  It seems it can be used for further experimentation
    with the plants of the New Earth.
