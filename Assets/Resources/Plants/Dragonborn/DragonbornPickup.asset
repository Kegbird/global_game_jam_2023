  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the Corylus X and the
    Medusa Flytrap. This relatively small tree has a central trunk, the branches,
    that are made of copper, are arranged in the shape of a dragon. Its perfectly
    spherical fruits grow nestled in the branches, when they are ripe they fall to
    the ground. It has been observed that these fruits are very high in nutrients,
    further studies must be conducted.  With the current technology it is possible
    further hybridization.
