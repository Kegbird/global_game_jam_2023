  _description: Only found in the Desert Region of New Earth, it is really rare to
    come by. When there are droughts in its habitat, it deploys the physiological
    strategy of drying up and rolling inwards to form a ball (similarly to the ancient
    resurrection plant). It can survive for a very long time and it is speculated
    that the specimen we have today are a thousand years old (there are no noticeable
    evolution changes).  With the current technology it is possible to hybridize
    this plant with some of the ones from the Old Earth.
