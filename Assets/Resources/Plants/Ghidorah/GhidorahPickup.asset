  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the Glacipila and the
    Dragonborn. Its fruits, that are delicious and contain a lot of nutrients, grow
    at an exceptional speed. Its trunk, covered in iridescent metal scales, is actually
    hollow and it stores inside a limitless quantity of water. This is an extraordinary
    specimen, such a thing has never been seen before. Unfortunately it cannot survive
    in the New Earth soil.  It MUST be a primary subject for the next hybridization.
