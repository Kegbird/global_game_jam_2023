  _description: It's the result of the hybridization between the Snowheap and the
    Cucurbita X. It's very similar to the Cucurbita X in shape and color patterns,
    the differences are that this new plant is smaller, has white stripes and the
    insides are composed of a jelly substance that, when melted, becomes drinkable
    water.  With the current technology it is possible further hybridization.
