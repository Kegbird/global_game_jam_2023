  _description: Its the result of the hybridization between the two hybrids Libra
    de Focus and the Life Herb. This flower is permanently on fire, no matter what
    we try, the flame never dies... it must burn from an internal source. It still
    cannot survive outside even with the genome of the two most resilient plants.
    There are definitely some improvements, but it's still not good enough. We are
    getting closer.  It MUST be a primary subject for the next hybridization.
