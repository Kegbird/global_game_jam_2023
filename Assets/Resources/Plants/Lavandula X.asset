  _description: It's the outcome of a multitude of hybridizations conducted on the
    Old Earth to create a stronger beneficial herb that would survive the drastic
    environmental changes. In its genome can be found traces of mint and sage, but
    the most relevant one is definitely lavender.  It seems it can be used for further
    experimentation with the plants of the New Earth.
