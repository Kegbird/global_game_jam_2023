  _description: It's native to the New Earth and it can be found in the Forest Region.
    It's remotely related to the now extinct Venus flytrap. It evolved dangerous
    metal-like spines around its "mouths" and even if it still planted in the ground,
    it can move its multiple heads freely, resembling a bunch of snakes. Be careful
    around this specimen.  With the current technology it is possible to hybridize
    this plant with some of the ones from the Old Earth.
