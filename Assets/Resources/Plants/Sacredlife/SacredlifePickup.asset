  _description: 'Its the result of the hybridization between the Hellflower and the
    Ghidorah. This is the ultimate life form: it can provide food, water and with
    its flowers it can cure any disease. The trunk is now a fully fledged dragon
    made of metal. The most incredible trait is that, hypothetically, it can live
    on forever.  It can survive on the New Earth.  We achieved our goal.'
