  _description: It is a shrub native to the New Earth, it can be found in the Mountain
    Region. From what has been observed, it is harmless, not edible and has no apparent
    medical use. It doesn't produce any flowers. The snow-like white pollen is really
    sticky and completely covers the leaves, it can be spread simply by touching
    the leaves and carrying it around.  With the current technology it is possible
    to hybridize this plant with some of the ones from the Old Earth.
