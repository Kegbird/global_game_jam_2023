  - 'I started working on plant hybridization as another attempt to bring back our
    planet to what it once was. '
  - 'Right now, all the plants that evolved freely on the New Earth cannot be useful
    to us humans, but - at the same time - the plants from the Old Earth that we
    developed in our laboratory cannot sustain life in the New Earth soil. '
  - 'But I think that my theory can change that and make the New Earth hospitable
    for the people again. '
  - Combining two seeds with the same binding properties with this new technology,
    it will be possible to hybridise the new Earth seeds with the ones we hold in
    our laboratory.
