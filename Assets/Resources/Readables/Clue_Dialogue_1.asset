  - 'Being the only human left on this Earth have its pros and cons. To me, the advantages
    outweigh the disadvantages. The silence brings to the concentration and the introspection
    of the self.  Furthermore, I don''t have to deal with rotten minds. '
  - 'The research work is going well, I can''t say the same about the amount of oxygen
    on this planet.  I hoped it would get better, but that is not the case. The situation
    seems even worse than the time the last little group of people left for Sorot.
    I''m never going there, being a researcher has been the perfect excuse not to
    go with those fools. '
  - Anyway, I made some progress.  It seems that the combination Lavandula X and
    Hailtree doesn't get any results.  On the other hand, the combination of Hailtree
    and Corylus X may lead to something.
