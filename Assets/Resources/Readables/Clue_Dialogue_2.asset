  - 'The extended experimentation in contact with nature is making me realize things
    that until not long ago where unthinkable for me. Everywhere, everyone I may
    have consulted would have said that we need to be as productive as possible.  '
  - 'Fast, snappy, always on point.  With calm though, I''m starting to perceive
    the real essence of things.  I found myself in harmony with my surroundings. 
    Could it be that... Have I always been wrong?  '
  - 'Maybe, even if everyone says it, this is not the right thing to do.  We should
    do like plants, in silence, they grow. They develop strong roots deep underground,
    so that the eye can''t see. But just like the soul, even if you can''t see it,
    it keeps growing. It feeds on all the things around it, both positive and negative. '
  - 'I have new results. Combine Cucurbita X with the Lion flower. I tried hybridizing
    the same Lion Flower with the Corylus X, but to no avail. '
