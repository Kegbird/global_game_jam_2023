  - "Lab Report #02 \u2013 Dr.Orion \u2013 Year 3023, May 23"
  - 'I have new results. Today I tried some hybrids with the Irongiant, but it was
    a complete disaster. '
  - 'The experimentation in contact with nature is making me realise things that
    until not long ago were unthinkable for me. Everywhere, everyone I may have consulted
    would have said that we need to be as productive as possible.  '
  - 'Fast, snappy, always on point.  '
  - "Now I\u2019m starting to perceive the real essence of things. I found myself
    in harmony with my surroundings. Could it be that... Have I always been wrong?"
  - 'Maybe - since everyone says it - this is not the right thing to do. '
  - 'We should do like plants do: in silence, they grow. They develop strong roots
    deep underground, where the eye can''t see them. But just like the soul - even
    if you can''t see it - it keeps growing.  It feeds on all the things around it,
    both positive and negative. '
