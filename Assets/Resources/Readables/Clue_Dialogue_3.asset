  - "Lab Report #03 \u2013 Dr.Orion \u2013 Year 3023, July 23"
  - 'I had hoped to have made progress but the seed of Catnip 2.0 ruined all my progress.... '
  - 'Yesterday I took some time to walk around without thinking about something new
    to discover. There are days I''d love to get rid of this spacesuit. I know it
    would mean my death, but I ask myself if - even for a second - it would be worth
    it. '
  - 'The sky today was really blue.  I witnessed it only a few times since it''s
    rarely this colour.  This brings me hope.  '
  - 'I remember when I was a kid, the sky was dark grey one day and light grey the
    next. The pollution was so high that even in the highest mountain villages it
    was impossible to see a bright blue sky.  '
  - 'The walk I did yesterday seems to have worked, my mind is clearer today. '
