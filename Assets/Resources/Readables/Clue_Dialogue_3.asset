  - It's rarely this color, I witnessed it only a few times. This brings me hope.
    I remember when I was a kid, the sky was dark gray one day, another day it would
    be light gray, to then be dark gray again. The environmental pollution was so
    high that even in the highest mountain villages it was impossible to see a nice
    sky. Now I can at least see a little blue.
  - 'The walk I did yesterday seems to have worked, my mind is clearer today. It
    may have been luck, but this morning I stumbled upon a valid combination: Medusa
    Flytrap and Corylus X. Some progress are made.'
