  - I remembered something. The day I've been told that one way or another I would
    have been sent to Sorot. At first I didn't say anything, but I felt an overwhelming
    emptiness growing inside of me. This planet is everything to me.
  - I've always been against to whom would have come to destroy it "for the good
    of mankind". If I chose to become a researcher, it's because of this Earth. And
    I don't want anything in common with the ones who think differently. They can
    say I'm a madman, I don't care. Even if, by the way, those are the same people
    that depend on me for the continuation of this project.
  - Isn't that ironic. I'm seriously thinking about stopping the transmissions. Anyways,
    I discovered the combination Lavandula X with Gehenna doesn't lead to anything.
    But the Gehenna seems to work well with the Cucurbita X. I should keep researching
    this.
