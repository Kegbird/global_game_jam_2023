  - "Lab Report #04 \u2013 Dr.Orion \u2013 Year 3023, October 23"
  - 'I didn''t think I could get it wrong again... I have to stop doing hybrids with
    Pittfall Gourd. '
  - 'I remembered something. The day I''ve been told that - one way or another -
    I would have been sent to Sorot. At first I didn''t say anything, but I felt
    an overwhelming emptiness growing inside of me. This planet is everything to
    me. '
  - 'I''ve always been against those who wanted to come and destroy it "for the good
    of mankind". If I chose to become a researcher, it''s because of this Earth and
    I don''t want to have anything in common with those who think differently. They
    can say I''m a madman but I don''t care. Even if they are the same people that
    depend on me for the continuation of this project. Isn''t that ironic. '
  - I'm seriously thinking about stopping the transmissions.
