  - "Lab Report #05 \u2013 Dr.Orion \u2013 Year 3023, December 23"
  - 'Update on the latest discovery: stay away from Pyrophite. '
  - Isn't that ironic. I'm seriously thinking about stopping the transmissions. Anyways,
    I discovered the combination Lavandula X with Gehenna doesn't lead to anything.
    But the Gehenna seems to work well with the Cucurbita X. I should keep researching
    this.

  - I'm thinking about leaving. I don't know if I will die or if there is going to
    be anything beside this piece of land that I have accurately inspected  for an
    entire year.
  - In December 3022 even my last research colleague left. He asked me to go with
    him but I refused. At this point I think that I made the right choice. There
    were only a few of us left here before, but at least someone was there.
  - ' I wasn''t used to the total absence of humans around me, but it made me realise
    something though: I understood how I actually think and - just because of that
    - I will leave. I will lose myself like never before.  '
  - 'I don''t know if somebody will read these messages, but if someone will find
    these scattered thoughts, I want them to actually understand the true meaning
    of this planet. I would like them to know its value. This is enough for me.  '

  - ...
  - 'Please, despite it all, take good care of this little planet, whoever you are. '
